I've been on the hunt for shirts. I wanted them to be of tools and services that I love. I typically wear plain, no logo, t-shirts.

Here I was sharing my wing span with a [SH](http://sodiumhalogen.com) client in my Evernote shirt.

They were asking how long it would take to make a few changes to their website. I asked if their list was *this* long. The client said it was no more of a thumbs-up size list. :)
