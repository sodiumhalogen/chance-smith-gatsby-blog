When you set a goal your mind won’t stop in helping you achieve that goal. Your creative mind turns on to help you achieve what you have set out to do.

**Your imagination is living and breathing.**

Your imagination is an *encourager*, an energy source, and a stubborn force.

Set your goal. Write down your goal. See your goal often. Speak your goal when you think about it. Believe it.

Your imagination will put you to work, when you’re ready to listen. Your imagination will encourage you to learn, if you are willing to be openminded.
