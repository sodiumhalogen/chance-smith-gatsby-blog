At [Sodium Halogen](http://sodiumhalogen.com?ref=chancesmithio-blog), we've seen many projects with different types of CSS methodolgies and frameworks (BEM, Bootstrap, Foundation, Bulma).

## CSS + React has been wonderful with Styled Components

For over a year we've been playing with ReactJS + Styled-Components. We've loved not having to worry about CSS naming and overwriting cascading effects. It's helped a ton.

## What about projects that need classes to style elements?

We've recently had a project that is vanilla CSS and JS. No frameworks at all! 🙀

We didn't see this coming. It's also been a bit since we have had to create/write classes. Components in React there was less context switching having all HTML, CSS, and JS all in one file. Context switching is mentally expensive and time consuming.

## Looking at Utility-First CSS

[Dan Mal](http://danmall.me/) (genius) was the first to introduce us to utility classses. You might have seen the [spacing utility classes in Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/utilities/spacing/) before.

Utility classes are tiny bits of CSS, tied to a class name, that do one thing. Here are a few examples...

```css
.flex-1 {flex: 1;}
.ml-5 {margin-left: 5px;}
.ml-10 {margin-left: 10px;}
.ml-20 {margin-left: 20px;}
.pl-5 {padding-left: 5px;}
.pl-10 {padding-left: 10px;}
.pl-20 {padding-left: 20px;}
```

## Pros for Utility-First CSS

- writing way less CSS
- more time in HTML (local space), less time in CSS files (global space)
- way less class name creation/modifying
- less BEM modifier class overhead

## Cons for Utility-First CSS

- not as easy to duplicate styles (templates/components really help with this)
- messy HTML, similar to inline-styles (we might just have to change the editor theme or look past it)
- not semantic-css names (CSS class names don't have to be semantic, but your HTML does)

## Tailwind Utility-First CSS Framework

At UndergroundJS conf in Nashville, TN, a few of us meet with another dev that introduced Tailwind.

We haven't used the Tailwind in our no-framework project, but we have been modeling our own utilities classes the same way. So far we're liking how much time we're saving on layout and spacing.

```css
  /* layout */
  .flex-24 {flex: 24 1 0%; margin-right: 30px;}
  .flex-7 {flex: 7 1 0%; min-width: 400;}
  .border-transparent, 
  .hover\:border-transparent:hover {
    border-color: transparent;
  }

  /* type */
  .uppercase {text-transform: uppercase;}
  .lowercase {text-transform: lowercase;}
  .capitalize {text-transform: capitalize;}

  /* spacing */
  .px-20 {padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;}
  .pl-20 {padding-left: 20px;}
  .pl-30 {padding-left: 30px;}

  /* size */
  .h-full {height: 100%;}
  .w-300 {width: 300px;}
```

We're going to give it a run by adding just what we need as we go. We'll be meshing BEM and Utility-classes.
