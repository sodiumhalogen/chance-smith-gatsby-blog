Own your opportunities<br/>
Own your ability<br/>
Own the risk<br/>
Own your results<br/>
Own your mistakes<br/>
Own your apologies<br/>

Taking ownership of your opportunities shifts an idea from something considered into an action taken.
Taking ownership of your errors and mistakes turns the experience from something transactional into a relationship.

Ownership is work. So get to it.
