Here is how I achieve high productivity and project manage teams using Asana.

Watch and tell me on Twitter what you think, [@chance_smith](http://twitter.com/chance_smith).

## My project management questions
- **What do I have to do today?**
  - How busy am I?
  - Do I have my day planned?
- **What is my availability?**
  - When can I take on more work?
  - How far booked out am I?
- **What is my cost (in time)?**
  - How many hours do I have budgeted?

These questions can be applied to yourself, but they can also be applied to each team member.
