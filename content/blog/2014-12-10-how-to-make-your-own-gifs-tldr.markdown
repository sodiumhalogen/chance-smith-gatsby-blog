How I made this gif on my Mac...

![chance smith cool thumb](http://chancesmith.org/gifs/chance-cool-were-on-it.gif)

#Apps needed:
* Photo Booth
* iMovie or Final Cut Pro (FCP)
* GifRocket

Honestly, you only need a video editor, like FCP and iMovie, if you want to be OCD and trim off any parts you don't want.

#How to make it:

* record a video with Photo Booth
* click&drag video onto deskstop
* drag video, from desktop, into FCP
* trim the length of video
* in FCP, export to desktop
* drag edited video into GifRocket

...and done.

Now show me your gif skills!

I'm waiting...
