When you have a dream, an idea, or a passion you just need to go for it. Most of the times when an idea comes to mind I always blow the reaction of others out of proportion in the negative way. I think the idea is great but I'm scared what they might think.
<blockquote>I think the idea is great but I'm scared what they might think.</blockquote>
A trait of a successful person: <strong>Do not care what others may say or think</strong>

It is important to seek the guidance of your spouse, friend, or mentor before taking a big leap. Yet, do not let them completely sway you.

<strong>When should I NOT care what others think?
</strong>When your idea is...
-something that you have a passion for
-Legal
-Fair to others
-Helpful to one person or many (yourself included is ok)
-Financies are available (no debt allowed)

Fear is not a reason for you to not continue. I love the part in <em>The Pursuit of Happiness</em> where the son puts out and tells his father he wants to be a pro basketball player. Will Smith(actor) selfishly, and out of protection, tells his son that he shouldn't go that route because of genetics or personal failures. This is a very popular scene and very motivational! If you haven't seen this movie I highly reccomend it and recommend you not watching this clip. Go ahead and rent it on Amazon or iTunes and see it in full.<em>
